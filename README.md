#I created an HTML  titled Interactive Kmap Qm Quantum. It contains:
#An interactive Karnaugh map (2–4 variables) — click cells or enter minterms/don't-cares; it updates the map and result.
#A Quine–McCluskey solver (2–6 variables) — shows prime implicants and a minimized SOP.
#A small Quantum circuit builder & simulator (1–3 qubits) — add H/X/Y/Z/CX/Measure gates, simulate statevector and measurement collapse, and see probabilities.
